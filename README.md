I knew I wanted to be a programmer since I was 15☺️, now I'm unlocking my dream by myself
learning English, taking courses, succeed and fail, *I love it when solving a problem or fixing a bug after a long search*✌️.
So I work with *HTML*, *CSS*, *SASS*, *React*, *Node*, *Mongodb*, **MERN Stack** in general and recently learning "Next.js".
 
I want to learn more about the JS family like React Native, etc 

Currently looking for an opportunity to gain hands-on experience to get even further with my skills
