When I first started to program I fell in love with it, loved to think, build things☺️, 
success and fail, *I love it when solving a problem or fixing a bug after a long search*✌️.
So I work with *HTML*, *CSS*, *SASS*, *React*, *Node*, *Mongodb*, **MERN Stack** in general and more
 
I want to learn more about the JS family like React Native, Next, etc 

I'm also interested in Python and Django I tried them before in some simple tutorials and am planning to learn more about it
